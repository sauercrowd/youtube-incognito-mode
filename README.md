# Youtube incognito mode

A chrome extension that lets you decide if videos you watch influence your Youtube suggestions.

## Limitations

Currently it only blocks views from influencing your suggestions, not searches.
Searches seem to only influence suggestions a lot less than watching, but you might still see your recommendations change slightly.
